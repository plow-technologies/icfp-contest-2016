1. to do a fold you have to have a crease orthogonal to the fold direction
2. folding from big to little seems like a good strategy.  I.E. Make big folds first!


Rules for a crease:

Crease must be bound on current outer polygon edge (point on the boundary).
Crease must be orthogonal to the direction of the fold

These two rules constrain the process of fold selection.

The idea here is you have your initial Paper.

Then use findValidFoldsForVertex on every exterior point. (preferably simultaneously)

This gives you a set of folds you could make.  So based on some rule, (I say the biggest fold)
you choose a fold to do.  This involves recalculating all the vertices on the initial side of the
crease to spots on the final side of the crease. (TO BE IMPLEMENTED).

Then checking to see A. are we the winner! B. are there any more valid folds left to do.

If the answer to B is no, we need to go back and get another point.

Assuming we have a valid skeleton this method should produce a right answer.  Though it is slow!
